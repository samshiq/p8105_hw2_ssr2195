# Problem 1

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, 
    station_longitude, starts_with("route"), 
    entry, vending, entrance_type, ada
  ) |>
  mutate(
    entry_logical = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
  )
```

This data set describes key details about the NYC subway system
including station names, routes served, ADA compliance and more. I
cleaned the data by using the janitor function to convert all names to
lowercase and replacing all spaces/special characters with underscores.
I then selected relevant variables and turned the entry variable from a
character type to a logical type, leaving a cleaner dataset with 1,868
rows and 32 columns.

    ## The number of distinct stations is: 465

    ## The number of ADA-compliant stations is: 84

    ## The proportion of station entrances/exits with no vending that allow entrance is: 0.3770492

    ## The number of distinct stations that serve the A train is: 60

    ## The number of ADA-compliant stations that serve the A train is: 23
