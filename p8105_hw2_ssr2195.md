# Problem 1

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, 
    station_longitude, starts_with("route"), 
    entry, vending, entrance_type, ada
  ) |>
  mutate(
    entry_logical = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
  )
```

This data set describes key details about the NYC subway system
including station names, routes served, ADA compliance and more. I
cleaned the data by using the janitor function to convert all names to
lowercase and replacing all spaces/special characters with underscores.
I then selected relevant variables and turned the entry variable from a
character type to a logical type, leaving a cleaner dataset with 1,868
rows and 32 columns.

    ## The number of distinct stations is: 465

    ## The number of ADA-compliant stations is: 84

    ## The proportion of station entrances/exits with no vending that allow entrance is: 0.3770492

    ## The number of distinct stations that serve the A train is: 60

    ## The number of ADA-compliant stations that serve the A train is: 23

# Problem 2

``` r
mr_trash_df = 
  read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  select(where(~ !all(is.na(.)))) |>
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(
      round(sports_balls, 0)),
    year = as.numeric(year),
    trash_wheel = "Mr. Trash Wheel")
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`

``` r
prof_trash_df = 
  read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel")
```

``` r
gwyn_trash_df = 
  read_excel("202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel")
```

``` r
trash_df =
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df, prof_trash_df, gwyn_trash_df)
```

The data set contains data collected by three different trash wheels in
Baltimore, MD. The dataset includes 1033 observations. Some key
variables in this dataset are `year`, which represents the year of trash
collection, `weight_tons`, which is the weight of trash collected in
tons, and `cigarette_butts`, which indicates the number of cigarette
butts collected.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 246.74
tons. Additionally, the total number of cigarette butts collected by
Gwynnda Trash Wheel in June 2022 is 1.812^{4}.
